Face Recognition Database Creator

Welcome to my first ever "big" (I know I will accomplish bigger stuff in the future, that's why there's the quotation marks) project I made using Python.
This was a work I did from a request sent to me online in 2021.

Purpose: This python application can be used to create a face database of multiple people.
Usefulness: You can then use the database created to train an AI with machine learning.
Why people ?
Well, the idea of the project was to help create a video automated attendance system using face recognition.

I hope you will make good and fair use of my program.
